<h1>Challenges posed to Yam Researchers</h1>
<p>The obstacles facing sustainably profitable cultivation of yam, and thereby food security and prosperity, are multitudinous. Studies
note farmers perceived threats or pests and diseases (e.g. termites, rodents, mealybug, nematodes, anthracnose, yam beetle, centipede,
dry rot, die-back), growth retardation yield loss, increase in production cost, low quality and/or scarcity of tubers, drought, 
unavailability of insecticide/pesticides, poor soil nutrient availability, and loss of market value. Challenges to research 
exacerbating these issues are yams’ notoriously long growth period, breeding efficiency, polyploidy, and low multiplication ratios 
which severely retard the rate of research progress. See <a href=”http://dioscorea.org/ongoing.html”>Ongoing Work</a> for research 
current research targets. </p>
